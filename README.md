# A plugin that adds support for products selling with checkout and cart funcationality, styles are ready
#### Make sure to run npm run watch to build the tailwind css located in rrstore-plugin/css
#### Make sure main theme is not conflicting with plugin styling - that is, pay attention if the main theme has any general css setup to html elements
#### if you want a fully independent plugin from the main theme, checkout the rrstore-rrsite-compatible branch, has full isolation of plugin pages with the style ready (blue and yellow)
The master branch is more dependent, it will havethe blue and yellow style but is affected by general styling on your website

### FEATURES:
This plugin allows you to easily: 
- Sell Products on your website, with price, image and description
- Cart functionality based on PHP cookies, no need for user logon
- Filter Products based on categories and price

#### For now refer to the rrstore-rrsite-compatible branch, master branch is still being worked on while work is mostly done on the independent plugin branch, that is with the plugin on that branch, on activation, you will immediately recieve all the features on your website without further modification on your end.
